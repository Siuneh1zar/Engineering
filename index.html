      This is my eight blog. This week we got into pares and worked on breadboarding.
      We breadboarded LED circuts, paralle & series. I learned how to breadboard. For challange day
      had a disscusion if taking a math course is better than counting 
      to 1,000,000. We came up that taking a math course is better.

       breadboarding and created patterns with it. I coded two patterns 
       and it actually worked. For challange day we had to come up with a 
       solution to cure cancer by filtering water. For Thanksgiving,
       I am going to fest. Im going to eat the table and leave no crumbes.
