    This is my second blog. I learned to design on tinkercad. I learned how to create a website.
    We're building a Rube Goldburg Machine. Tinkercad was hard at first
    but it got easier later on. The project is really fun.

  This week we have to work in our groups and its been going well. We also did a boat challange for challange day. Our Rube Goldburg Machine had a screw,lever, and wheels.
  I love my group, its so much fun. When Mr.Poole wasnt here on thrusday, we did a E challange. We we're suppose to draw a E with measures and the switch with somebody and try to draw their E.
  I am looking forward to work with my group again and have fun!

       This is my Sixth blog. Mr.Poole is back! We were working on Laptop Dissection. 
      It was fun but it was also fraustrating. Some of the screws wouln't come out 
    but overall it was a fun project. I learned how to open up a computure. 
    it was very hard to work on the laptop, so I felt fustrated.

      This is my eight blog. This week we got into pares and worked on breadboarding.
      We breadboarded LED circuts, paralle & series. I learned how to breadboard. For challange day
      had a disscusion if taking a math course is better than counting 
      to 1,000,000. We came up that taking a math course is better.

       This is my nine blog. This week we kept working on our
       breadboarding and created patterns with it. I coded two patterns 
       and it actually worked. For challange day we had to come up with a 
       solution to cure cancer by filtering water. For Thanksgiving,
       I am going to fest. Im going to eat the table and leave no crumbes.
       I am going out with my friends and my side pice (jk). Overall, I am very

       this week was all about design. Ayan and me made our design in tinkercad.
       For challange day we were paired up with another person to make 
       the longest bridge with 15 post-its. My parnter and I got second place.
       Which is really good, we got 101 inches.

       This is week I was out but my partner worked on the mousetrap,
       setting up the basic objects and making it work. I got covid,

       This week we finished our mousetrap. We are trying to add bigger wheels
       to make it go furture. We are going to make the wheels out of cardboard
       and glue it at the tip of the stick. This week we added the CDs,
       glued the mousetrap and the string and more. We pretty much built
       the whole thhing out. 
       
       <img src="mousetrap2.jpg" width = 500px; height = 400px>
       
      This is our finish project, we are still thinking if we should
      add the bigger wheels or no.

   This week we worked more on our mousetrap, did lots of testing.
   On thrusday we finally did our competatioon and our car went the furthest.
   We made ou stick longer and that helped with the distance it went.I learned how
   to make a mousetrap car, and how to control the distance it will go.
   I was very happy with our final project, our hard work payed off.
